forge "http://forge.puppetlabs.com"

# The following are modules to be installed on the Learning VM and persist
# after the build process.
#
# For modules that are published on the forge, the default is
#   to use the forge module. The git repos are added and commented
#   out purely for convenience.
# For modules that aren't published on the forge, we specify that the 
#   master branch from the corresponding git repo be used.
# To fetch a specific version of a forge module, use:
#   mod 'pltraining/rbac', '1.0.1'
# To fetch a ref (commit, branch, or tag) from a git repo, use:
#   mod 'bootstrap',
#     :git => 'https://github.com/puppetlabs/pltraining-bootstrap',
#     :ref => 'ref-goes-here'
